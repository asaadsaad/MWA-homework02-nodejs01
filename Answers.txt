Exercise 1
1
Ans: We would want to use setImmediate instead of setTimeout if we immediately want to execute the function without any timeframe.

2
Ans: The process.nextTick is called and executed at first before any other asynchronous code present in
both micro queue as well as event loop whereas the setImmediate adds any function in the check
phase of the event loop and executes it immediately before any other timers present in the code.
Also, process.nextTick has high priority than setImmediate.

3
Ans: 
Core modules
1.querystring
2.path
3.url
4.events
5.os
6.fs
7.http
8.util
9.buffer
10.stream

Global objects
1.process
2.console
3.setTimeout
4.clearTimeout
5.setInterval
6.clearInterval
7.setImmediate
8.clearImmediate
9.require
10.module

Exercise 2

async function factorial(x) {
    if (x === 0 || x === 1) return 1;
    return x * await factorial(x-1);
}
console.log("start");
factorial(999).then(console.log);
console.log("end");
