1.Explain why do we want sometimes to use `setImmediate` instead of using `setTimeout`? 
Ans: It depends on how we insert the task in the Task Queue.When we need to insert task after certain time then we use setTimeout(f,time), it has two arguments function and time, 
where as if we need to insert certain task immediately we should use setImmediate(f), which has only on argument i.e. function.

2.Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
Ans: process.nextTick(f) method push the synchronous task that has highest prioroty to the nextTick Queue where as 
setImmediate(f) insert the asynchronous task to the check Queue inside the Task Queue.

Write a function in Node factorial(n) to find asynchronously the factorial of a number. Write your observation (CPU, RAM.. etc) on what happens in Node Process when we calculate the factorial of a large number.

async function factorial(x) {
    if (x === 0 || x === 1) return 1;
    return x * await factorial(x-1);
}
console.log("start");
factorial(999).then(console.log);
console.log("end");

When 3 digits number is passed as argument, it shows infinity,
When 2 digits number is passed as argument, it shows Maximum call stack size exceeded error.
