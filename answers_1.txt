# MWA Homework 02 - NodeJS 01
## Written Exercises
1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use `setImmediate` instead of using `setTimeout`? 
2. Explain the difference between `process.nextTick` and `setImmediate`?
3. Name 10 core modules that Node provides by default, and 10 of the Global objects?


1. We sometimes want to use `setImmediate` because when in a I/O cycle, setImmediate() is executed before any timers. 
Whereas if there are multiple timers and we use `setTimeout`, it adds to the existing queue not guaranteeing its execution and also 
not until the next tick if inside a I/O cycle.

2.  `process.nextTick` is given the most priority over any other tasks. Adding any task to nextTick queue makes sure that before
any microTask and the event loop are paused and that any events in the nextTick queue is completed first. Whereas, `setImmediate` adds the
task to be executed during the check stage of the libuv event loop, so it doesn't guarantee immediate execution despite the name.

3. core node moudles are:-
    i. fs
    ii. os
    iii. process
    iv. readline
    v. zlib
    vi. worker
    vii. http
    viii. http2
    ix. console
    x. assert


global objects are :-
    i. __dirname
    ii. __filename
    iii. exports
    iv. module
    v. require
    vi. global
    vii. setImmediate
    viii. clearImmediate
    ix. setInterval
    x. setTimeout
