Exercise 1

1. We sometimes want to use setImmediate instead of setTimeout, if we want to priorotize certain execution.

2. If we use setImmediate, script will execute after all currently executing scripts have completed. 
On the other hand, if we use process.nextTick, script will execute at event loops next tick. So it has highest priority.

3. Core modules: http, fs, path, util, os, crypto, assert, stream, events, console
   Global objects: process, buffer, console, module, require, exports, global, setTimeout, setInterval, __dirname
   
Exercise 2

function factorial(num) {
  if (num === 0) return Promise.resolve(1);
  else {
    return new Promise((resolve) => {
      factorial(num - 1).then((result) => {
        resolve(result * num);
      });
    });
  }
}
